- ✅ Severity classification (low, medium, high, critical)

### 📈 **Advanced Credit Score Impact Analysis**
- ✅ Sophisticated credit score impact calculations
- ✅ Utilization ratio analysis and recommendations
- ✅ Potential score improvement estimates
- ✅ Item-specific impact scoring (late payments: 15pts, collections: 50pts, etc.)
- ✅ Personalized recommendation generation
- ✅ Real-time analysis quality indicators

## 🛠 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **PDF Processing Architecture**
```typescript
// Enhanced PDF text extraction with robust error handling
const extractTextFromPDF = async (file: File): Promise<string> => {
  // Dynamic PDF.js import
  // Worker-free configuration
  // Timeout protection
  // Memory cleanup
  // Comprehensive error handling
}
```

### **Analysis Pipeline**
```typescript
// Phase 2 enhanced analysis flow
enhancedAnalyzeCreditReport() {
  1. Real vs. mock data detection
  2. Enhanced pattern-based extraction
  3. Multi-bureau analysis
  4. Advanced violation detection
  5. Credit score impact calculation
  6. Personalized recommendations
}
```

### **Pattern Recognition System**
- **Account Detection**: 15+ regex patterns for various account formats
- **Creditor Identification**: Business entity recognition with 50+ patterns
- **Date Parsing**: Flexible date format handling (MM/DD/YYYY, MM-DD-YYYY, etc.)
- **Amount Extraction**: Currency parsing with comma and decimal handling
- **Status Recognition**: Payment status classification with fuzzy matching

## 📊 **Enhanced Mock Data System**
